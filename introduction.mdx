# Welcome to yangleyland/configs

A carefully curated collection of configuration files that create a powerful, keyboard-driven development environment. Built for developers who value efficiency, aesthetics, and seamless integration between tools.

## What's Inside

This repository brings together four essential tools, each configured to work harmoniously with the others:

</CardGroup>

## Philosophy

This configuration is built around three core principles:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Keyboard-First Navigation">
    Every tool is configured with vim-style keybindings, minimizing mouse usage and maximizing efficiency
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visual Consistency">
    Coordinated color schemes and theming create a cohesive aesthetic across all tools
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modern Features">
    AI integrations, GPU acceleration, and contemporary tooling for a cutting-edge development experience
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Neovim Configuration

The heart of this setup is a LazyVim-based Neovim configuration with extensive customization.

### Key Features

- **Package Manager**: Uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for fast, efficient plugin management
- **Base Framework**: Built on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) for sensible defaults
- **AI Integration**: Configured for AI-assisted coding workflows
- **Obsidian Support**: Native markdown and note-taking integration via obsidian.nvim

### Plugin Highlights

```lua
-- Color Schemes (nvim/lua/plugins/colorscheme.lua)
return {
  { "rebelot/kanagawa.nvim" },
  { "NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme" },
  { "ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim" },
  { "rose-pine/neovim" },
  { "tiagovla/tokyodark.nvim" },
  { "sainnhe/everforest" },
  {
    "navarasu/onedark.nvim",
    opts = {
      highlights = {
        Visual = { bg = "#ffff00" },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Obsidian Integration

Seamlessly work with Obsidian vaults directly from Neovim:

```lua
-- nvim/lua/plugins/obsidian.lua
opts = {
  workspaces = {
    {
      name = "personal",
      path = "/Users/leylandyang/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Sharedvault",
    },
  },
  completion = {
    nvim_cmp = true,
    min_chars = 2,
  },
  daily_notes = {
    folder = "/daily notes",
    date_format = "%m-%d-%Y",
  },
}
```

## Tmux Configuration

A clean, efficient terminal multiplexer setup with vim keybindings and modern aesthetics.

### Core Features

```bash
# tmux/tmux.conf

# Vim mode in copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi

# Remap prefix to Ctrl+Space
set -g prefix C-Space

# Mouse support
set -g mouse on

# Catppuccin theme
set -g @plugin 'dreamsofcode-io/catppuccin-tmux'
```

### Vim-Style Copy Mode

```bash
# Enter copy mode with Prefix+[
bind-key [ copy-mode

# Vim-like navigation in copy mode
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'v' send -X begin-selection
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'y' send -X copy-selection
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'V' send -X rectangle-toggle
```

<Note>
  The prefix key is remapped from the default `Ctrl+b` to `Ctrl+Space` for easier access
</Note>

## Alacritty Configuration

A modern, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator with carefully chosen aesthetics.

### Visual Configuration

```toml
# alacritty/alacritty.toml

[window]
padding.x = 10
padding.y = 10
decorations = "Buttonless"
opacity = 0.8
blur = true
startup_mode = "Maximized"

[font]
normal.family = "0xProto Nerd Font Mono"
size = 16
```

### Theme Setup

```toml
# Import the Coolnight theme
general.import = [
    "~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/coolnight.toml"
]

[env]
TERM = "xterm-256color"
```

<Note>
  The configuration includes access to 100+ pre-configured themes in the `alacritty/themes/themes/` directory
</Note>

## AeroSpace Configuration

A powerful tiling window manager designed specifically for macOS, bringing i3-like functionality to Apple's desktop.

### Vim-Inspired Navigation

```toml
# aerospace/aerospace.toml

# Focus windows with vim keys
alt-h = 'focus left'
alt-j = 'focus down'
alt-k = 'focus up'
alt-l = 'focus right'

# Move windows with vim keys
alt-shift-h = 'move left'
alt-shift-j = 'move down'
alt-shift-k = 'move up'
alt-shift-l = 'move right'
```

### Workspace Management

```toml
# Quick workspace switching
alt-1 = 'workspace 1'
alt-2 = 'workspace 2'
# ... up to alt-9

# Alpha-numeric workspaces for organization
alt-c = 'workspace C'  # Code
alt-w = 'workspace W'  # Web
alt-m = 'workspace M'  # Music
```

### Smart Features

```toml
# Automatic behavior
start-at-login = true
enable-normalization-flatten-containers = true
on-focus-changed = "move-mouse window-lazy-center"

# Layout configuration
default-root-container-layout = 'tiles'
default-root-container-orientation = 'auto'
```

<Warning>
  AeroSpace is macOS-only. If you're on Linux, consider i3, sway, or bspwm instead
</Warning>
